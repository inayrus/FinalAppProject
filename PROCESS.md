## Day 1
I picked between two different API options that can convert handwriting into digital text: Google Mobile Vision and Microsoft Computer Vision. I requested a Microsoft API key, because they offer a trial verion where you don't have to enter a creditcard number. However, this key will be valid for 7 days, so I'd have to request a new one every week, but right now I'm okay with that.

I also looked into a what makes a good interface design and worked to finish my proposal by sketching some ideas for the user interface. These are the current designs, where the converted note activity visualizes what the app would look like after a photo has been turned to text.

However, I'm still thinking about where to put the option to create a new folder and to put a note in a folder. I also haven't yet included a sketch for the camera and the photo album view.

## Day 2
I looked a bit more into how other note apps displayed certain features, such as folders and note options (delete, share). This caused me to redesign the layout of my app. I used this new design to build my design document.

I spend most of the day putting together the advanced sketches and I realized I probably need to do more things than expected to get the app working. Right now, I think I would need two databases, where one is used for the actual notes and one for the app settings, like the tags. I also discovered I probably need to add a camera API for the feature to make an in-app photo.

## Day 3
Today was the first stand-up. My feedback from Pjotr was to try to focus on the  minimum viable product features first, so I decided to currently leave it with one database and worry about the settings and tag details later.
