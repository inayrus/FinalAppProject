## Day 1
Picked between two different API options that can convert handwriting into digital text: Google Mobile Vision and Microsoft Computer Vision. I requested a Microsoft API key, because they offer a trial verion where you don't have to enter a creditcard number. However, this key will be valid for 7 days, so I'd have to request a new one every week, but right now I'm okay with that.

I also looked into a what makes a good interface design and worked to finish my proposal by sketching some ideas for the user interface. These are the current designs:

![new note activity](http://url/to/img.png)
![folder activity](http://url/to/img.png)
![detail activity](http://url/to/img.png)

However, I'm still thinking about where to put the option to add a note to a folder and to create a new folder. I also haven't yet included a sketch for the camera and the photo album view.
