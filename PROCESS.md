## Day 1
I picked between two different API options that can convert handwriting into digital text: Google Mobile Vision and Microsoft Computer Vision. I requested a Microsoft API key, because they offer a trial verion where you don't have to enter a creditcard number. However, this key will be valid for 7 days, so I'd have to request a new one every week, but right now I'm okay with that.

I also looked into a what makes a good interface design and worked to finish my proposal by sketching some ideas for the user interface. These are the current designs, where the converted note activity visualizes what the app would look like after a photo has been turned to text.

However, I'm still thinking about where to put the option to create a new folder and to put a note in a folder. I also haven't yet included a sketch for the camera and the photo album view.

## Day 2
I looked a bit more into how other note apps displayed certain features, such as folders and note options (delete, share). This caused me to redesign the layout of my app somewhat. I used this new design to build my design document.
