# FinalAppProject: Note Organization App

## Summary
My name is Valerie Sawirja and this is an app proposal for the final project of the minor programmeren.
The main goal of this app would be to be able to store and organize typed notes and handwritten notes in the same place. 
With this app, the user can make new notes, save them in different folders, and edit them.


## Problem statement
People usually write things down to remember it at a later time. This could be a to do list written on a scrap piece of paper, or an overheard quote typed on a phone. The way we make notes isn’t always consistent, even though we sometimes wish it was. It’s easy to print documents and make digital text physical, but it’s a bit more effort to turn handwritten notes digital. Especially in the case of longer texts, like lecture notes.

## Solution
To solve the problem of having to type the notes to make them digital, this app includes a feature that turns handwritten notes into digital texts with a photo. 

### Features
These are the features I would like to implement:
1. let people create new notes:
    - can type a note as normal
    - can take a photo or upload a photo of text to convert to digital text 
2. possible to format the text: bold, highlights, text sizes.
3. organize files in folders by adding tags
4. exporting files (email, whatsapp, google drive, ect.)

### Sketches
* an overview activity with all the notes and including a floating action button
  * possibility to filter on a tag/ folder
* a note detail activity when clicked on a note in the overview
* a new note activity when clicked on the floating action button
  * includes an option to upload a photo
  * includes options to format text

## External Components
* SQLite
* Microsoft Computer Vision API
