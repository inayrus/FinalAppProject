# Noted

Noted is a note making app, created during the Minor Programming of the University of Amsterdam. A few features are creating and editing notes, organizing notes with tags, and handwriting recognition. The handwriting recognition allows the user to upload a photo with handwritten text on it and let the app turn the recognized handwriting into digital text. This text can then be edited and added to a note.

The app has three screens. There is an overview screen with all the notes, which includes a filter option

![filter after](https://github.com/inayrus/FinalAppProject/blob/master/doc/Screenshot_filter_postlist.png)

The second screen is the Note screen, which the user is directed to when they click a note in the overview or the plus sign. Here, the user can use either of the three actions in the tool bar: handwriting recognition from a photo, adding tags to a note, or deleting a note.

Choosing handwriting recognition in the toolbar opens the third screen. Here the user is prompted to select a photo, after which a convert button will appear. Clicking this button starts the handwriting recognition. The result appears in a textbox, where the user can edit the text and add it to the note.

Choosing the Tags option lets the user choose and create new tags. There tags will also appear in the filter list in the overview.

Clicking the delete option will open a pop-up that asks for confirmation.
